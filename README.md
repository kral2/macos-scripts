# MacOS Scripts

## Introduction

A place to store some MacOS system commands I had to run at a moment.
It should eventually grow to become a foundation to bring a new macOS installation to my desired state.

Largely inspired by [StefanScherer/mac-dev-box](https://github.com/StefanScherer/mac-dev-box) and other osx-install Gists.

This is the 2020 reboot of this repository as I am back to mac :-)

## Goals

Main goal: collect information about the configuration state of the operating system at a given time, and try to rebuild that state when needed (e.g: reinstall from scratch).

Secondary goal:

- enable/disable settings in a reproducible and documented manner
- code my project management workflow

## Usage

Execute each script independently as needed. Prerequisites are not documented/checked in the current version.
